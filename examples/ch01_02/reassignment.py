# This simple program just print "This is my first Python program"
# To let you see how change the output if I re-assign a value to the variable, i will add some comments

x = 7
# the value of x is 7
print(x) # print 7
x = 15
#Now, x will be 15
print(x) #print 15
print(x+3)
#This print doesn't change the value of x
print(x) #print 15
