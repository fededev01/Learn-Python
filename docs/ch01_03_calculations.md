## Introduction
The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work just like in most other languages (for example, Pascal or C); parentheses (()) can be used for grouping.

### Example

```python
(50 - 5*6) / 4
```

The output will be the following:
```output
5.0
```

You can also enter a calculation directly into the print statement:

```python
print((50 - 5*6) / 4)
```

The output will be the same:
```output
5.0
```




```python

```

The output will be the following:
```output
