# Syntax
This page will show you some basic rules about Python.
Here you can find the [Main Page](https://fededev01.github.io/Learn-Python)

## Indentation
In other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation.
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, but it has to be at least one.

```python
a = 20
b = 10
if a > b:
    print("A is bigger than B")
else:
    print("B is bigger than A")
```

## Comments
Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.
Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:

```python
#This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Print
In Python, we use the print statement to output text:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

The output should read:

```
Hello, World!
```
