## Introduction
Variables play a very important role in most programming languages, and Python is no exception. 
Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable allows you to store a value by assigning it to a name, which can be used to refer 
to the value later in the program.
Variables are containers for storing data values.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
To assign a variable, use one equals sign.
Assigning a variable doesn't produce any output at the Python console.
