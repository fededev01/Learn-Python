## Introduction
Variables play a very important role in most programming languages, and Python is no exception. 
Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable allows you to store a value by assigning it to a name, which can be used to refer 
to the value later in the program.
Variables are containers for storing data values.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
To assign a variable, use one equals sign.
Assigning a variable doesn't produce any output at the Python console.

### How does it works

```python
x = 7
print(x)
```

The output will be the following:
```output
7
```

Now, if you want add 3 to x, you will write this:
```python
print(x + 3)
```

And the output will be this:
```output
10
```

Then, if you want print another time the value of x, write this:
```python
print(x)
```
The output will be 7:
```output
7
```

Note that after the addition x+3, the value assigned to x is 7 yet.

Another example of using variables in Python, is this:
```python
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)
```
Output will be:
```output
5
John
```

As you can see, the variable stores its value throughout the program.
